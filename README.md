- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrNicoleB
- 👀 I’m interested in Epidemiology and Data Science.
- 🌱 I’ve just started learning Data Science as I'm aiming to become a Health Data Scientist.
- 💞️ I’m currently looking to collaborate on any entry-level General Data Science and Health Data Science projects to build my competence in these areas.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: drnicoleb.md@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently switching fields from Medicine to Health Data Science... Which isn't as hard a shift as I had previously thought it would be, because patients are living data lol and I'm enjoying the process!
